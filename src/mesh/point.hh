 * TODO:
 * - This Point notation is used in:
 * 		- fields, in particular value and value_list method
 * 		- io, output_element, output_mesh
 * 		- bih_tree, bounding box
 * 		- With own definition in fem/maps... !!
 * - not used in:
 *      - Mesh, Node
 *      -
 * Used single Point definition in mesh and reuse it elsewhere.
 * Do not use it in BIH, in order to make BIH separate library (WIP).
 * Try to use Armor instead of Armadillo fixed vectors.
